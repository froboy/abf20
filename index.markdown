57th Street Books will share 10% of all Book Fair proceeds with Ancona. These funds are then used to enhance Ancona's library collection. Just **mention "Ancona21" in the comment field at checkout**. 
Ancona staff have created a wishlist of books for their classrooms, which can be found here: https://www.semcoop.com/wishlist/1917. 
Please note, as is standard with in-person book fairs, purchases made for the virtual fair will not accrue frequent buyer credit on members' accounts.
 
Get great books - check.  Support a neighborhood business - check.  Support Ancona readers - check!
